```

This will:
- Create a backup of your existing database (if any)

```

If your Chrome passwords CSV is not in the default location, you can specify the path:

```bash
python scripts/import_chrome_passwords.py /path/to/your/chrome_passwords.csv
```

## Step 4: Verify the Import

After importing, you can run the main application to verify that your passwords were imported correctly:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting
